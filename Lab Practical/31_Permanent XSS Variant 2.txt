-> Permanent XSS Variant 2

We see browser names are printed. If we look at http request, it the same sting from the User Agent header in the HTTP request.

Intercept request with Burp, replace user agent with abcd and the table wil show abcd on top.

Now we can put any HTML in useragent and it will be stored XSSl User Agent: <script>alert("xssed")</script>
