5. Send the POST request in Burpsuite to Turbo Intruder (right-click > send to turbo intruder)

6. Download wordlist.txt (we can provide a link for this)

7. Change the wordlist path from: /usr/share/dict/words to the location where wordlist.txt is stored.

8. Replace 9D with %s in the Post Request and click attack.

9. Click on words to sort the result via words, and you will find 3 Employee Ids [6Y,9D,3C]

This approach can be used to perform other types of bruteforce attacks as well.
